Learning Documents
------------------

Here are the files I use for teaching computer science students how to learn about github.

For a more integrated approach to learning about github via using the eclipse IDE, look at
[this prep lab](https://github.com/onzfonz/learning-docs/blob/master/7.%20Git%20Prep%20Mini-Lab.docx)
and then work with a team of 3 or 4 to complete [this team lab](https://github.com/onzfonz/learning-docs/blob/master/8.%20Git%20Team%20Lab.docx)


If you want something that is used for unity but has more of a git command line, start with
[the unity prep lab](https://github.com/onzfonz/learning-docs/blob/master/Unity%20Git%20Prep.docx) and 
then move on to work in teams of 3 and 4 to finish [the unity team lab](https://github.com/onzfonz/learning-docs/blob/master/Unity%20Git%20Team%20Lab.docx)
